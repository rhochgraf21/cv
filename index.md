Hi, I'm Robert, a sophomore at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am majoring in Computer Science, with immersions in Public Policy (completed) and Psychology (in progress). In my spare time, I enjoy producing electronic music and researching performance optimization.

You can find me on campus at RIT's Computer Science House.
